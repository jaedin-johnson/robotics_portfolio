# Jaedin's Robotics Portfolio

Description of the bot: Our robot is named Burnout. The frame will be a simple box, with one wheel attatched to the back and two to the front. With our straightforward design, we hope to create a robot that prioritizes speed without sacrificing turning ability and maneuverability through and around obstacles.
