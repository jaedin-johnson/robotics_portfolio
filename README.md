# Jaedin Johnson's Robotics Portfolio (2023-24)

### Description of the bot: 
Our robot, Burnout, will have a simple chassis, with one wheel attatched to the front and two in back. It will inlcude four motors in each corner of the frame. A scoop will be secured to the front with the goal of moving and carrying small objects. With our straightforward design, we hope to create a robot that prioritizes speed without sacrificing maneuverability or turning radius through and around obstacles.
